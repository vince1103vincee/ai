Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with
text generation. It enhances large language models by providing them with relevant context
from a knowledge base before generating responses.

A RAG system typically consists of three main components: a document processor that chunks
and prepares documents, a vector store that stores and retrieves embeddings, and a generation
model that produces answers based on retrieved context.

RAG systems are particularly useful for question-answering systems, chatbots, and applications
that require up-to-date or domain-specific knowledge. They allow models to access information
beyond their training data, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.
