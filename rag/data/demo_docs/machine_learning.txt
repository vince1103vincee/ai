Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve
from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs
that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and
reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. Unsupervised learning
finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error.

Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests,
support vector machines, and neural networks. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses
neural networks with multiple layers to process complex patterns.
